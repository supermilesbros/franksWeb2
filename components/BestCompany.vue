            <p>“The first river you paddle runs through the rest of your life”.
                That sure was the case for me. I grew up in a family of avid backpackers
                on my mother’s side who instilled a love of nature and appreciation for the
                environment in me as a young man. Growing up, my father owned a 17’
                Grumman canoe, which he since passed down to me. Dad bought that
                canoe in 6th grade after a summer’s worth of picking strawberries for
                money. I’ve still got the 50+ year old canoe, her name is Holga and she
                still sees regular use. After my first canoe-camping trip, I started planning
                less hiking trips once I realized that backpacking is just one long portage
                �� For the past decade plus, I’ve worked as a compliance associate in
                biomedical research for the Indiana University School of Medicine. From
                my father owning an independent insurance agency, to my mother being a
                licensed pharmacist to my own background in regulatory compliance – I
                take our customer’s safety very seriously. It is my goal to help the citizens
                and visitors of Indy alike to experience the joy and tranquility of paddling a
                moving stream in a comfortable and responsible manner.
                &quot;What makes a river so restful to people is that it doesn&#39;t have any doubt;
                it is sure to get where it is going, and it doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere else.&quot;
                Daily 21 st Century life can be so very stressful, and this has only been
                exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are a plethora of peer-
                reviewed psychological studies showing the sound of running water can
                have a positive impact on our minds. Researchers believe that the sound
                of water can guide the neuronal waves in our brain, allowing for a calming
                effect. We know without a doubt that green and/or blue spaces improve
                mental health. As someone who has experienced anxiety/depression
                struggles in my life, I find that being in, on or around the river washes the

                worries of society away for a time and helps me reconnect with myself and
                the loved ones around me. It is my goal to highlight the wonderful benefits
                of Indianapolis’ waterways and turn Indy into the River City it should be!
                Like our partners at The Parks Alliance of Indianapolis, I too believe in the
                power of public spaces to transform a city. In my view, The White River is
                inherently one of Indianapolis’ prevailing public spaces. People need
                access to the rivers, and we aim to give it to them! Because when our
                spaces are open and accessible, our city is too.</p>

            <p>Frank Turner Bloomquist rolled into Peter’s life in the early
                spring of 2004, shortly after Peter’s mom Kathy passed from a prolonged
                battle with cancer. Frank did his best to fill a human-sized hole in the heart
                of 16-year-old Peter even if he was small enough to sleep in the palm of
                Peter’s hand when they first met. Frank was the largest puppy in his litter
                and quickly went from being a lil ball o fat at 6 weeks to a lean and
                muscular 32-pound adult Boston Terrier. His tongue grew too large to fit in
                his mouth, so it was always visible. He could jump over 6 feet into the air,
                never quite knew what his feet were doing, but ran full-speed into every
                adventure presented to him. He was a part of Peter’s identity, and loved
                everyone he came into contact with (as long as they shook Peter’s hand).
                This dog was an expert at reading people’s emotions – from comforting
                those in grief to partying with the boys; all those that knew him were
                influenced by his spirit. Frank’s Uncle Karl once said: “I’ve never known a
                dog who was so down with whatever was going on.” Frank loved water,
                especially rivers. He canoed rivers throughout the Midwest including sand-
                bottom rivers in Indiana, mud bank rivers in Wisconsin and raucous class
                III+ rivers in Tennessee/Kentucky. He grew up with a gnarly but
                affectionate cat as a mentor and inherited the 9 lives. He fell off cliffs, got
                hit by cars, stuck his face in hornets nests and turned blue from trying to
                swallow a pork chop whole. Cancer got him in 2014, but not before he
                gained a sister in Kate’s husky named Bella and made sure his best friend
                was set-up for the next stages in life. Frank commonly gets the credit for
                Peter’s ability to woo Ms. Kate.</p>
